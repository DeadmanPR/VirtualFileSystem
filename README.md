# Brief Explanation
This project attempts to recreate what would be a Virtual File System. It includes a terminal (CLI) from which several functions can be done. Each version has its own README file.

# Differences between v1 and v2
v1 uses the Serializable Java class to save Object states and information.
v2 implements the INode structures, **but** several functions were not implemented due to time constraints.
